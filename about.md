The {{ site.title }}  acts as a catalyst at the junction of science, data, and software, facilitating and accelerating advances across multiple disciplines.  Scientific software is used throughout the scientific lifecycle, from initial data acquisition in sensor systems, to data management, quality assurance, data integration, analysis and synthetic modeling.  Software touches every activity in science, and yet, it is largely invisible and unmanaged.  The {{ site.title }} changes this through programs in four fundamental services at the interface of science, software, and data:

- Science-software working groups
- Community building 
- Comprehensive training in data science
- Support and consulting
